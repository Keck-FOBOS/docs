\section{Schedule, Budget, and Funding Path}
\label{sec:budget}

\subsection{Funding Path}

Early funding for FOBOS has been obtained as follows. Conceptual
development of Fiber-WFOS for TMT provided the backbone of the
current FOBOS design. Grants for targeted studies include: a 2016 UCO
mini-grant (K.-G.~Lee) for initial collaboration development; 2017
UCO mini-grants for microlens fore-optics conceptual development
(K.-G.~Lee) and the sky-subtraction fidelity of existing fiber
systems (K.~Bundy); WMKO 2018 white-paper funds (K.~Bundy; ongoing)
to develop science cases, build science teams, and perform
focal-plane and spectrograph design studies; and a 2018 UCO
mini-grant (K.~Bundy; {\it FIDDLES}, ongoing) to design and fabricate
a microlens-coupled fiber system to demonstrate its throughput at
Keck compared to lab measurements and to simultaneous observations
with DEIMOS. The latter builds on UCO's ongoing investment in a
fiber-testing facility needed for a number of internal projects has
helped to further the FOBOS design.

This Phase-A funding request is designed to bring the project to a
stage of readiness needed to submit proposals to the NSF MSIP (2020)
and MsRI-2 (2023) programs (see Table~1). We intend to propose for
FOBOS design funds via an MSIP solicitation expected in early 2020;
if successful, this will fund the full instrument-design phase. The
construction funding would then come from a MsRI-2 proposal in 2023.
The duration of our Phase-A request, late 2019 to mid 2021, will
allow for continued development between submitting our MSIP proposal
and when the funding is made available. In the event that we are
unsuccessful in the MSIP proposal, we will refocus Phase-A funding
during the latter half of this proposal period toward preparation of
an MsRI-1 proposal in 2021. Additional funding proposals for smaller
grants (e.g., UCO mini-grant, NSF ATI) will be sought as necessary
and available. These grants would target relatively self-contained
design components of FOBOS's overall system. Other government funding
and private funding is also being pursued as opportunities become
available.
