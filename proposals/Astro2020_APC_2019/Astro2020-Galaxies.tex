\subsection{A Comprehensive Picture of Galaxy Formation}

With both single-fiber and multiplexed IFU observations, FOBOS will produce rich and comprehensive data sets at faint source magnitudes.  Its blue sensitivity affords UV absorption studies down to $z \sim 1.5$, enabling detailed mapping of the baryonic environment at the peak formation epoch.  Samples at $z=1$--$2$ will not only characterize how this environment and its impact on galaxies evolves but will also provide large training sets that can be used to extract spectroscopic-like information from the billion-plus galaxy samples observed in all-sky surveys.  These data will be used in concert with large samples of spatially-resolved FOBOS observations (in IFU mode) to set the context for highly-detailed studies of targeted samples with James Webb Space Telescope and the U.S.~Extremely Large Telescopes.  Finally, FOBOS can tie evolutionary behavior seen at early times to the present day by faint sub-structure and dynamical tracers in nearby galaxies.

\subsubsection{The $z$$\sim$2 galaxy ecosystem}
\label{sec:z2galaxies}

With surveys like MOSDEF \citep{kriek15} and KBSS
\citep{steidel14}, MOSFIRE has provided powerful new
insights into early galaxies at the $z$$\sim$2 peak-formation epoch.
However, a complete picture of the galaxy ``ecosystem'' at this key
epoch must also consider the gas-filled environments. Using
Ly$\alpha$ absorption in background galaxies, a tomographic map of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) in regions surveyed by MOSDEF and KBSS
is a key first step. The promise of this approach, demonstrated at
Keck by \citet{lee14}, motivates FOBOS's UV sensitivity, target
flexibility, and multiplex for tomographic mapping of large-scale
structure, including protoclusters \citep{lee16}, voids
\citep{krolewski18}, and filaments \citep{horowitz19}.
\citet{2018arXiv181005156S} take IGM tomography in a new direction,
demonstrating with simulated observations that quasar ``light echos''
--- spatial signatures of the expanding ionization front of a newly
activated quasar --- can be detected and used to infer opening angles
and deconstruct the quasar's accretion history (see Fig
\ref{fig:LightEcho}). The required FOBOS spectra can simultaneously
constrain the CIV mass density (via $\lambda\lambda$1548,1550 \AA)
and patterns of CIV enrichment on both IGM and circumgalactic scales,
revealing the imprint of galaxy fueling and feedback processes
\citep[e.g.,][]{tumlinson17}.

\subsubsection{Role of environment at $z=1$--$2$ }

At later times, the IGM is increasingly confined to galaxies and their dark matter halos but these halos increasingly
merge to form larger structures.  FOBOS will be particularly important for mapping out environmental effects at
$z=1$--$2$ on galaxy evolution at the group scale ($\mathcal{M_\ast/M_\odot} \lesssim 10^{13}$).  With sufficient
exposure time, tens of thousands of satellites down to sub-L$^*$ luminosities can be mapped and characterized. Thanks
to deep, wide-field imaging surveys, like LSST, a 1M-object environmental survey at $z=1$--$2$ may then be possible
using improved photo-$z$s, strong priors on spectral types, and new machine-learning techniques to deliver {\it
spectroscopic} redshifts (with $\lesssim$300 km/s accuracy) at the lowest signal-to-noise possible (exposure times
reduced by factors of 4--5).

\subsubsection{Internal structure of galaxies at intermediate redshift}

MaNGA \citep{bundy15} and other large IFU surveys are defining the
$z=0$ benchmark for how internal structure is organized across the
galaxy population. To understand and test ideas for how this internal
structure emerged, we require spatially-resolved observations at $z =
1$--2, just after the peak formation epoch. Indeed, Keck has
pioneered such observations \citep[e.g.,][]{erb04, miller11,law09}.
Samples have so far been limited to a few hundred sources; however,
FOBOS will obtain resolved spectroscopy for thousands of galaxies
using its multiplex IFU-mode. Bright optical emission-line tracers
for this unprecedented sample of galaxies will reveal their gas-phase
and kinematic structure. Stacking restframe $\lambda \approx 4500$
spectra will enable radial stellar population analyses to constrain
how stellar components formed and assembled. Although initially
limited to coarse spatial scales, ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO)
in combination with FOBOS would be transformative for this science. A
corrected FWHM of 0.2-0.3 arcsec would enable fine-sampling IFUs to
probe smaller galaxies and study sub-structure on 1--2 kpc scales.


\subsubsection{The dark and luminous content of nearby galaxies}

Environmental effects and evolutionary processes evident at higher redshift have consequences that can be tested in present-day galaxies.  Using globular cluster and planetary nebulae as tracers, FOBOS will
dramatically advance dynamical studies of nearby galaxies with
$\mathcal{M_\ast/M_\odot} \lesssim 10^{11}$, capturing the majority
of the $\sim$1000 GCs located within $\sim$50 kpc of typical hosts
\citep[see][]{2013ApJ...772...82H} and tightly constraining their
dark matter halos. FOBOS's multi-IFU mode will additionally provide
powerful insight on the origin of dwarf galaxies, both compact and
ultra-diffuse (UDGs), in the field and in nearby clusters like Coma
and Virgo.

% which typically host $\lesssim1500$ GCs
% \citep{2013ApJ...772...82H}, FOBOS makes it possible to acquire
% spectra for nearly all GCs located  from the host
% galaxy in a single night. These data will allow us to map the
% chemodynamics of massive galaxy halos and infer orbital families as a
% function of stellar-population properties. Additionally, these data
% will inform models of GC formation in the context of the larger
% galaxy population.

% \subsection{Cluster galaxy populations}

% Presently, it is very expensive to conduct systematic spectroscopic
% studies of the various galaxy types in rich galaxy clusters, like
% Coma, due to their angular spread on the sky. With FOBOS's flexible
% fiber-positioning system and 17-arcminute FOV, it will be possible to
% simultaneously (and efficiently) build up an unprecedented library of
% spectroscopic redshifts and stellar-population parameters of galaxies
% in clusters towards intermediate redshift. Follow-up FOBOS
% observations using its deployable mini-IFUs will allow us to
% simultaneously obtain resolved spectroscopy for 10s of these cluster
% galaxies, enabling us to associate internal structures/properties of
% the galaxies with their host cluster.

% From George:
% - fill out case for probing both galaxies and their “gas-filled
%   environments”
%    - make it more explicit that getting large numbers of redshifts
%      would make it possible to trace out large-scale structure in
%      detail
%    - enables studies of galaxy properties as a function of environment
%
% - also mention targeting galaxies along QSO lines of sight
%    - much higher target density than with LRIS, DEIMOS over larger FOV.
%
% - Worth discussing Lyman-alpha or metal-line tomography?  
%
% - More quantitative comparisons with existing data sets?
%    - What key science questions can FOBOS address that many years of
%      LRIS and DEIMOS observations have not been able to?  Surely some
%      level of the spectral tagging and photo-z training can be done
%      (and surely is being done) with existing data.  Is FOBOS going to
%      be a huge leap, or will it mainly be cleaning up neglected corners
%      of parameter space?
%
% - More excited to hear about how the FOBOS spectra will be used for
%   science directly, instead of support for LSST
