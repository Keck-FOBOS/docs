\subsection{Dynamical masses of galaxies large and small}

Using point sources at large radius one can obtain the mass profiles of galaxies well into the regime where the mass is dominated by the dark-matter halo.  FOBOS makes these observations more than order of magnitude more efficient than can be currently done with DEIMOS, both because of the larger FOV and the higher multiplex.

dynamics, ultra faints?; or scratch that for something more recent}

\subsection{The volume density and chemistry of gas in between galaxies}

Not sure if there's anything new here.

\subsection{The Proto-galaxy Ecosystem at $z$$\sim$2}
\label{sec:galaxies}

% From George:
% - fill out case for probing both galaxies and their “gas-filled
%   environments”
%    - make it more explicit that getting large numbers of redshifts
%      would make it possible to trace out large-scale structure in
%      detail
%    - enables studies of galaxy properties as a function of environment
%
% - also mention targeting galaxies along QSO lines of sight
%    - much higher target density than with LRIS, DEIMOS over larger FOV.
%
% - Worth discussing Lyman-alpha or metal-line tomography?  
%
% - More quantitative comparisons with existing data sets?
%    - What key science questions can FOBOS address that many years of
%      LRIS and DEIMOS observations have not been able to?  Surely some
%      level of the spectral tagging and photo-z training can be done
%      (and surely is being done) with existing data.  Is FOBOS going to
%      be a huge leap, or will it mainly be cleaning up neglected corners
%      of parameter space?
%
% - More excited to hear about how the FOBOS spectra will be used for
%   science directly, instead of support for LSST

Understand the $z \sim 2$ galaxy ``ecosystem,'' including not only
the galaxies themselves but their gas-filled environments. The goal
is to build a comprehensive picture of the physical processes that
fuel proto-galaxy growth, shape their internal structure, and
influence their environment.

\noindent\comment{Cooper?} Build SDSS-like statistics for galaxies at
this key cosmic epoch. Exploit short spectroscopic exposures in
combination with photometry to provide environmental diagnostics for
1M galaxies at $z$=1--2. Photometric redshifts, while acceptable in
large cosmological analyses, wash out information about the local
position of galaxies with respect to one another. To characterize a
galaxy's local environment and identify its neighbors requires
(observationally expensive) spectroscopic redshifts. However, with
improved photo-$z$s available from Challenge \ref{photozs} and strong
priors on spectral types (Challenge \ref{phot}), the challenge here
is to push machine-learning techniques to deliver
\emph{spectroscopic} redshifts (with 300 km s$^{-1}$ accuracy) at the
lowest signal-to-noise possible. Reductions by factors of 4--5 in
exposure time would enable FOBOS to complete a 1M galaxy environment
survey at $z=1$--$2$ in just 20-30 nights.
