\subsection{Unraveling the Formation History of our Local Group of Galaxies}
\label{sec:localgroup}

Our Local Group of galaxies --- the Milky Way (MW), the Magellanic
Clouds, Andromeda (M31), Triangulum (M33), and numerous 
satellite galaxies --- allows us to study one realization of the
galaxy-formation process in superb detail. In the next decade, LSST
and WFIRST will increase the census of stellar streams and halo
substructure in these galaxies by a hundredfold. Follow-up
\emph{stellar} spectroscopy will constrain stream orbits and the
total mass they enclose \citep{2017ApJ...836..234S}, as well as the
associated age and chemical composition (see below).

% \chal{mwhalo} 
% %
% \item[] {\textsf {\large  Data-Science Challenge \ref{mwhalo}: The
% chemical evolution and assembly history of the MW stellar halo.}}  Using current MW halo models, we will simulate FOBOS
% stellar spectroscopy of main-sequence turn-off
% and red-giant stars in these substructures within the MW that also
% leverages existing data from, e.g., APOGEE and H3.  We will build
% data-driven models based on these data to measure stellar parameters
% (temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and alpha-element abundance)
% for all halo stars with LSST+2MASS+WISE+WFIRST multi-band photometry,
% allowing us to reconstruct the star-formation history of each disrupted
% satellite. These will be combined with dynamical data and compared with
% cosmological simulations to build a generative model for the assembly
% history of the MW stellar halo.

% \chal{m31} 
% %
% \item[] {\textsf {\large Data-Science Challenge \ref{m31}: The
% differential chemical evolution of M31 and MW.}}  A natural extension of
% Data-Science Challenge \ref{mwhalo} is to perform the same analysis for the
% halo of M31.  However, we cannot expect to obtain high-quality spectra
% of individual main-sequence stars at the distance of M31 with FOBOS.
% Moreover, training a chemical evolution model using spectra of Milky Way
% stars may lead to systematic errors:  The Milky Way and Andromeda have
% distinct evolutionary histories \citep[e.g.][]{2005MNRAS.356.1071R},
% despite being relatively similar in many other respects.  We will
% therefore obtain deep observations of giant stars in the M31 halo to
% drive a machine-learning algorithm that combines a model of the MW halo
% with results from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to constrain
% the differential history of the MW and M31 stellar halos.

% \chal{gaia} 
% %
% \item[] {\textsf {\large Data-Science Challenge \ref{gaia}: Stellar
% parameter determinations for a billion stellar spectra.}} While
% providing on-sky motions and photometry for 1.7 billion stars in the MW,
% fewer than 10\%, 0.3\%, and 0.1\% of stars will have a full complement
% of astrometrics and kinematics, basic stellar parameters, and chemical
% abundances, respectively.  Moreover, Gaia distance errors increase
% quadratically with distance.  To realize Gaia's full potential, we will
% design FOBOS training sets that, when combined with high-resolution
% datasets from, e.g., APOGEE, WEAVE, will allow us to build data-driven
% models of the absolute magnitude (yielding distance modulus),
% temperature, surface-gravity, and stellar abundance for {\it all} stars
% in the Gaia dataset.  These data will allow us to isolate coeval
% populations in the Galactic disk that can be combined with very
% high-resolution simulations of the Milky Way to provide a detailed
% evolutionary history of our Galactic home.
