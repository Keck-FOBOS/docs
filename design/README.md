## Current Strawman design

The baseline design for FOBOS is as follows:

 - Keck 10m primary mirror
 - ~15 arcmin diameter FOV (patrol)
 - Multiplex of 400 with 7x0.57 arcsec mini-IFUs per target (~1.7 arcsec
   overall on-sky aperture for each target)
 - Wavelength: 350-1000nm
 - Spectral Resolution: R~2500-4500 (from blue-red)
 - Nominal seeing: 0.6" (median 0.4" with GLAO upgrade)
