% \bigskip
% \noindent {\bf Overview:} In this \emph{Design}
% submission, we propose to dramatically enhance the power of upcoming
% panoramic deep-imaging from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),
% Euclid and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) in order to
% address key questions in the areas of dark energy, the galaxy ecosystem
% at $z\sim2$, and the assembly history of the Milky Way and Local Group
% Galaxies.  We will design the astrostatistics, instrumentation, and
% software solutions required over the next decade to provide optimized
% spectroscopic training sets that can unlock \emph{physical
% information} (e.g., redshifts, galaxy star formation histories, stellar
% metallicities) from deep photometry alone.  Applying machine learning to
% a set of ambitious Data Science Challenges using simulated data, we will define
% requirements on future spectroscopic training sets.  These requirements
% will guide the preliminary design of FOBOS, a powerful new spectrograph
% to deploy in 2026 on the 10 m Keck II Telescope.  FOBOS will provide
% publicly-available deep, high-multiplex spectroscopy with high target
% sampling and flexibility uniquely matched to the ``Big Data'' training
% problem.

% \bigskip
% \noindent {\bf Intellectual Merit:} High-multiplex and deep
% spectroscopic followup of LSST and other panoramic deep-imaging surveys
% is a widely recognized necessity.  Reports in 2015 and 2016 by the
% National Research Council and National Optical Astronomical Observatory
% specifically recommend that the NSF support construction of required
% spectroscopic facilities because none currently exist or are planned at
% U.S.\ observatories.  FOBOS satisfies these spectroscopic needs at
% relatively low cost by utilizing the existing 10 m Keck II Telescope, a
% highly-successful U.S.-led large telescope.  Even with the powerful capabilities of FOBOS deployed, the astronomical
% community recognizes the need for cutting-edge data science techniques to ``train''
% vast photometric surveys with what will necessarily be more limited
% spectroscopy.  Success in the training methodologies we propose here
% will make photometric redshifts more precise, improving the LSST dark
% energy figure-of-merit by 40\%.  They will enable a comprehensive
% understanding of galaxies and their gaseous environments at $z\sim2$,
% and they will reveal fossilized structures in the Milky Way, M31, and
% other Local Group galaxies through chemical signatures inferred for
% millions of stars.

% \bigskip
% \noindent {\bf Broader Impacts:} We will build on the success of several ongoing programs at UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) that
% connect high school and college students, especially those from underrepresented minorities, to active research groups.
% Studies show that such connections increase STEM retention.  The flagship program is Akamai, run by UCSC's Institute
% for Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE), which advances college students from Hawai'i into the STEM workforce.  Our
% proposal supports two Akamai interns to work at UCSC on instrument simulation and design as well as machine learning
% for spectroscopic analysis.  We will also engage a cohort of graduate students in ISEE's Professional Development
% Program which builds teaching skills as students develop an inquiry-based activity. The graduate students will then
% conduct this activity, centered on FOBOS instrument development, with 25 largely underrepresented community college
% students from UCSC's Lamat program.  Finally, we will take advantage of a successful hands-on research course and a
% long-running summer internship program to introduce data simulation and machine-learning techniques to 1st-year
% undergraduate and senior high school students.

\section{Scientific Justification} 

\subsection{Introduction}

Led by NSF's LSST\footnote{
%
LSST: Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. LSST will be begin science
operations in 2023.} and NASA-supported missions like
Euclid\footnote{
%
Euclid is led by the European Space Agency with significant NASA
involvement and will launch in 2021. Its primary mission is a 15,000
deg$^2$ imaging survey in optical and near-IR wavebands.} and
WFIRST,\footnote{
%
WFIRST: The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, expected to launch
in the mid 2020's.} astronomy is entering a new era of unprecedented
deep-imaging campaigns that will survey huge volumes of the universe.
From the emergence of the earliest galaxies from a ``primordial
soup'' of gas and dust, through the epoch of cosmic expansion, to the
evolved structure of present day galaxies in our own Local Group,
these surveys will provide unprecedented insights into key epochs of
cosmic history.

% Meanwhile, the rate of cosmic expansion was beginning to accelerate,
% as the Universe became increasingly dominated by ``Dark Energy,''
% whose origin remains the single greatest mystery in astronomy and
% cosmology today.

% Since Edwin Hubble's observations over 100 years ago,

Even so, as the success of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) made
clear, the scientific value of panoramic imaging increases
dramatically when coupled with intensive spectroscopic followup. But
for LSST and WFIRST, this presents a challenge. At the end of the
next decade, these facilities will deliver imaging data across vast
areas, 1,000 times deeper than SDSS. \textbf{No current U.S.~facility
is capable of obtaining spectroscopic follow-up at these depths} at
the level required to capitalize on the $\approx$\$4B the U.S.\ is
investing in these projects. In fact, an SDSS-like spectroscopic
study of 1 million galaxies at LSST depth would require 300 years of
observing on the largest telescopes with current instrumentation!

This proposal addresses this challenge through the design of an
ambitious spectroscopy facility on one of the world's largest and
most productive telescopes. Timed to deploy on WMKO's\footnote{
%
WMKO: W.~M.\ Keck Observatory operates the twin 10m Keck Telescopes.}
Keck II Telescope in 2028 (just as various panoramic deep imaging
surveys begin reaching their target depths), FOBOS's\footnote{FOBOS:
Fiber-Optic Broadband Optical Spectrograph} 1800-fiber multiplex,
deep sensitivity, high sampling density, and broad wavelength
coverage will be poised to obtain the \emph{deep-drilling}
spectroscopic training sets required to extract maximum information
from wide-field photometry. Its flexible target allocation system and
multiplexed IFU mode provide unique capabilities for realizing major
progress on fundamental goals in Cosmology, Galaxy Formation, and
Local Group Archeology. FOBOS provides direct benefits to the U.S.\
community (beyond traditional Keck users) through community-led,
public key science programs. Additional ``open-access'' to
$\sim$100,000 fiber-hours per year will support PI-led programs from
U.S.\ astronomers. Finally, raw, reduced, and high-level data
products (e.g., redshifts, line fluxes, continuum fits) will be
publicly released for \emph{all} FOBOS observations and served on a
science-ready platform.

\subsection{Key Science Goals}
\label{sec:goals}

FOBOS's flexible focal plane and IFU capabilities enable a breadth of
science, including PI-led, survey-defined, and queue-scheduled
programs that can be integrated to maximize the science return.
Apportioning FOBOS access in units of fiber-hours, instead of the
more typical night-based allocation, grows the scientific pie by
allowing small programs with rare targets in the ``long tail'' to
observe alongside one or more medium or large programs. Such a model
becomes possible in the deep-wide imaging era where source densities
of potential targets (40 arcmin$^2$ at $i_{\rm AB} = 25$) far exceed
FOBOS's fiber density (6 arcmin$^2$).

The range of possible science investigations beyond the key programs
we introduce below is impressive: Milky Way and M31 halo stars and
substructure; the Milky Way bulge; globular clusters; variable stars
from cadenced LSST imaging; dwarf galaxies; rapid time-domain
followup with an always-ready IFU; structure of Coma and Virgo
galaxies with IFUs and using globular clusters and PNe as tracers;
large IFU samples at $z \sim 1$ of 2D emission-line kinematics;
galactic winds; radial stellar-population trends from stacked spectra
at $z \sim 1$; environmental group identification at $z \sim 1$--2;
galaxy cluster and proto-cluster followup; QSO light echos in the
IGM; redshift calibration of LBG samples at $z = 1.5$--5 for CMB
lensing cross-correlation.

Turning to ambitious, large-scale FOBOS efforts, we present three
``design-reference'' programs that represent our primary science
goals and drive science requirements. An underlying theme in these
programs is delivering the spectroscopic training sets required to
enable an array of deep-learning approaches that can leverage
panoramic photometry over much larger areas than can be surveyed
spectroscopically at depth. These programs highlight FOBOS's
capabilities in addressing the nature of Dark Energy, the formation
of galaxies, and the assembly history of the Andromeda Galaxy system.

\subsubsection{Enhancing Dark Energy Probes via Precision Cosmic Distances}
\label{sec:cosmology}

The quest to understand the accelerating cosmic expansion has
motivated billions of dollars of investment in efforts world-wide ---
culminating in the ``Stage IV'' dark energy missions LSST, Euclid,
and WFIRST --- that seek highly precise measures of cosmic structure
to constrain the evolving dark-energy equation-of-state. Delineating
the growth of cosmic structure requires measurements of galaxy
positions and gravitational shear as a function of distance over vast
cosmic volumes. For the billions of sources that will be imaged by
these surveys, distances must be derived from photometric redshifts
(photo-$z$s). Among other challenges, if the photo-$z$s are
inaccurate it can introduce significant errors in cosmological
results (e.g., Huterer et al. 2006) \comment{ref}. Improving galaxy
photo-$z$ estimates through deep, targeted spectroscopic training and
calibration samples would propagate through to substantially improve
the cosmology results of \emph{all} of these missions, for all
cosmological probes, not just weak lensing.

The {\it FOBOS Cosmology Program} will play a critical role by
training photo-$z$s from sources that are too faint for other
instruments, like PFS,\footnote{Subaru's Prime Focus Spectrograph,
which begins commissioning in 2021.} but will dominate the number of
galaxies and cosmic volume probed by panoramic deep imaging in the
next decade. Complete spectroscopic training samples to $i_{AB} =
25.3$ will \emph{increase the LSST's dark energy figure-of-merit by
40\%} \citep{newman15}. FOBOS's strength in this endeavor goes beyond
sensitivity. With no ``redshift desert,'' thanks to its unique
ability to measure spectroscopic redshifts above $z > 1.5$ via
rest-frame UV features, the FOBOS Cosmology Program will dramatically
reduce the need for expensive, space-based\footnote{Ground-based
near-IR spectroscopy is too contaminated by night-sky emission lines
to provide spec-$z$s at the required level of completeness
\citep{newman15}.} near-IR spectroscopy.

\begin{enumerate}[rightmargin=0.2cm,leftmargin=0.2cm]

\item[] {\textsf {\large FOBOS Cosmology Program:}}
  For a set of 12 0.1 deg$^2$ FOBOS pointings arranged evenly in
  right ascension and chosen to overlap with the LSST, Euclid, and
  WFIRST footprints, this program will execute ultra-deep
  integrations of $\sim$15,000 $24 < i_{AB} < 25.3$ sources using
  1200 single fibers (per pointing) from two of FOBOS's three
  spectrographs. Fiber-IFUs from the 3rd spectrograph will be used
  for simultaneous FOBOS Galaxy-Ecosystem Program observations (see
  below). The depth is chosen to be well-matched to the depth of the
  majority of the LSST and WFIRST weak lensing shear sample. To
  maximize the power of the resulting photo-$z$ training sample, we
  will carefully choose the sample such that it efficiently spans the
  full LSST/WFIRST color-magnitude space, as described in
  \citet{masters15, masters19}. We will dynamically re-allocate
  fibers to new targets as successful redshifts are obtained (i.e.,
  some fibers will deliver multiple spec-$z$s). The longest
  integration times per field will exceed 100 hours. With two-thirds
  of the available fiber-hours allocated, this program would require
  23 effective dark nights per year for 5 years. Spectra from this
  program would be reduced and made public immediately, yielding huge
  scientific returns beyond photo-$z$ training and calibration.
  Specifically, it would naturally double as a highly detailed probe
  of galaxy evolution over cosmic time.

\subsubsection{Mapping the Baryonic Ecosystem of Early Galaxies at All Scales}
\label{sec:galaxies}

The fueling and regulation of galaxy growth during the peak formation
epoch ($z \sim2$--3) is critically tied to the turbulent and gas-rich
ecosystem in which early galaxies evolve. The James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) and upcoming extremely large (30-m class) telescopes
(ELTs) will marshal powerful infrared observations to study the stars
and nebular gas at the heart of these early galaxies. But to map out
their crucial link to the extended gas reservoirs, diffuse halos, and
streaming filaments that dominate the mass in these environments
requires an instrument like FOBOS. Its deep sensitivity and high
sampling density enables comprehensive tomographic reconstruction of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) across the largest cosmic structures
in a single pointing ($\sim$10 transverse Mpc at $z \sim 2.5$). Its
blue sensitivity probes Ly-$\alpha$ across the complete formation
epoch ($z = 1.5$--3.5) and opens access to high-ionization
transitions that reveal diffuse gas \emph{in emission}, such as O VI
(1032 \AA). Finally, its ability to combine single-fiber and
multiplexed IFU observations allows us to map the density and
dynamical state of diffuse gas at all relevant scales from the IGM to
the circumgalactic medium (CGM).

%
\begin{enumerate}[rightmargin=0.2cm,leftmargin=0.2cm]
%
\item[] {\textsf {\large FOBOS Galaxy Ecosystem Program:}} (1) We
will map the IGM in 5-pointing mosaics (0.5 deg$^2$) around each of
the 12 Cosmology pointings at a depth of 3 hours. This depth ensures
sufficient Ly-$\alpha$ absorption mapping with a sight-line density
of $\sim$1600 per FOBOS pointing across absorber redshifts, $z =
1.5$--3.5 \citep[see][]{lee16}. Field selection will take advantage
of quasar-quasar pairs at \comment{range or exact number?} certain
redshifts. The number of fields and mapped area will capture the
largest modes of large-scale structure while also limiting sample
(``cosmic'') variance. This program component requires a total of 26
nights, spread over 5 years. (2) Jointly with the FOBOS Cosmology
Program, which will use two-thirds of FOBOS's fiber complement,
one-third of FOBOS's fibers will be configured into 15 37-fiber IFUs
(5.6 arcsec on-sky diameter) and map emission lines from the CGM.
Capitalizing on 100-hour integrations, these observations will allow
unprecedented measurements of the CGM {\it in emission} on 5 kpc
scales out to $r < 23$ kpc for $z \sim 2$ galaxies spanning a range
of $\mathcal{M}_*$ and SFR. The final sample of nearly 200 direct CGM
maps will link the buildup of the CGM through heating and gas flows
to the cosmic web on large scales (mapped via IGM tomography) as well
as the internal structure of the galaxies themselves (as observed by
JWST and at high resolution by ELT instruments). This program component
utilizes the equivalent of 11 nights of dark time per year for 5
years, {\it but runs jointly with the FOBOS Cosmology Program}.
%
\end{enumerate}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Assembly of Andromeda's Disk and Satellite Galaxies}
\label{sec:localgroup}

Facilities like Gaia and APOGEE are probing the assembly history of
the Milky Way and its halo by mapping their chemodynamical structure
in unprecedented detail. In the next decade, a major goal is to build
toward this level of understanding for the Andromeda Galaxy, its
halo, and its satellite galaxy population. Instruments like PFS with
degree-scale fields of view that span 20 kpc or more at M31 distances
are well suited to characterizing M31 halo structure. However,
FOBOS's much higher sampling density is critical for breakthrough
datasets of stellar tracers in the M31 disk, M33, and Andromeda's
major satellites. High S/N FOBOS spectra will map patterns of [Fe/H]
and [$\alpha$/Fe] and link these chemical tags to the underlying
dynamics with unprecedented statistical power. Combining these FOBOS
observations with integral-field data from the SDSS-V Local Volume
Mapper and PFS surveys of halo structure, a complete picture of the
Andromeda system's formation history will address key questions about
disk evolution, dwarf galaxies, and substructure that have so far
been limited to the Milky Way subsystem.

\chal{stellar} 
%
\begin{enumerate}[rightmargin=0.2cm,leftmargin=0.2cm]
%
\item[] {\textsf {\large FOBOS Andromeda Program:}} This program will
survey 100,000 (primarily) RGB stars in the M31 disk and inner halo,
10,000 stars in M33, and a further 15,000 stars in the central
regions of Andromeda's major satellites: NGC 147, NGC 185, NGC 205,
and And II. Accounting for a 60\% rejection rate
\citep[see][]{dorman12} due to crowding of ground-based RGB catalogs
($i_{Vega} < 22.5$), on-sky densities of 6 pointings in the
PHAT\footnote{Describe and reference PHAT.} region between 5--20 kpc
average 1 isolated source every 10\arcsec{}, suitable for 10
independent fiber assignments per pointing. Two disk pointings beyond
20 kpc will be visited once. With integrations an order-of-magnitude
longer than SPLASH\footnote{Describe and reference SPLASH.}, total
integrations of 10 hours per visit provide ${\rm S/N} \approx 20$ per
resolution element for the faintest targets, which is sufficient for
radial velocity and [Fe/H] measurements with <1 km/s and 0.1 dex
precision. At the ``sweet-spot'' of RGB tracers ($i_{Vega} = 21.5$),
we expect spectral ${\rm S/N} \approx 50$, which will provide
[$\alpha$/Fe] to 0.1 dex precision. Six 10-hour visits will cover M33
and 3 visits each are assigned to NGC 147, NGC 185, NGC 205, and And
II. This program requires 24 nights per year for 5 years.
%
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scientific Benefits to the U.S.\ Community}

We propose community engagement activities to coordinate involvement
of U.S.~astronomers (especially those outside the Keck Community) in
developing and leading FOBOS public survey programs whose data
products will benefit wide swaths of the astronomical community. In
partnership with NSF's OIR Lab (formerly NOAO), we will develop
additional ``open-access'' models to offer $\sim$100,000 fiber-hours
per year in support of individual, PI-led programs to be integrated
into the FOBOS observing suite. NSF's OIR Lab will build planning and
simulation tools for proposers and facilitate open access time
allocation.

To further define FOBOS key science over the proposal period, NSF's
OIR Lab will also solicit additional key program concepts from the
U.S. community, host workshops to discuss and refine these concepts,
and coordinate proposing teams ahead of a competed selection process
to define design-reference programs in support of Preliminary and
Final Design. We will also use our established
connections\footnote{Co-I Schafer is Co-Chair of LSST's ISSC.} to
LSST's Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration (ISSC) to
advertise, recruit, and coordinate efforts on deep-learning tools for
both key science and FOBOS operations (e.g., MAISTRO).

Finally, we have emphasized the design of software platforms
necessary for a seamless user experience from target submission to
data product retrieval and analysis. FOBOS will be the first
\emph{general-purpose} spectroscopic instrument to automatically
provide high-level data products such as redshifts, stellar continuum
fits, and emission line measurements. With a commitment to the public
release of such products derived from \emph{all} FOBOS observations,
these data products will dramatically reduce the time from
observations to science. The team has delivered previously in this
regard, providing the first comprehensive high-level data product
package for an SDSS survey with MaNGA's\footnote{MaNGA: Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory, one of three core
programs in SDSS-IV completing in 2020. Bundy also serves as the
MaNGA PI. Westfall, the FOBOS Project Scientist, led development of
MaNGA's Data Analysis Pipeline.} Data Analysis Pipeline
\citep{westfall19} and its interactive public science platform,
Marvin \citep{cherinka19}.



% \subsection{Research Community Priority} 
% \label{sec:community}

% The need for spectroscopic follow-up in the LSST era was made clear in
% the National Research Council's 2015 report, ``Optimizing the U.S.
% Ground-Based Optical and Infrared Astronomy System'' \citep{NAP21722}:
% %
% \noindent\begin{center}\mbox{\parbox{0.95\linewidth}{
% %
% The National Science Foundation should support the development of a
% wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability on a medium- or
% large-aperture telescope in the Southern Hemisphere to enable a wide
% variety of science, including follow-up spectroscopy of Large Synoptic
% Survey Telescope targets. Examples of enabled science are studies of
% cosmology, galaxy evolution, quasars, and the Milky Way.
% %
% }}\end{center}

% Workshops organized by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO)
% in 2013 and 2016, the latter at the NSF's request, reported specific
% spectroscopic needs for LSST follow-up in all science areas.  In
% particular, the 2016 report notes that a critical resource in need of
% prompt development is to ``Develop or obtain access to a highly
% multiplexed, wide-field optical multi-object spectroscopic capability on
% an 8m-class telescope.''  Based on these recommendations, we propose the
% FOBOS instrument coupled with a suite of data-driven tools to address
% the spectroscopic requirements of LSST and other photometric surveys at
% a final cost 20 times less than a new Southern Hemisphere facility.
% Located in Hawaii, FOBOS can access more than 70\% of the LSST
% footprint, more than adequate for building powerful
% spectroscopic training sets.  Compared to the Prime Focus Spectrograph
% (PFS) on Japan's Subaru Telescope, FOBOS would be 1.7$\times$ faster,
% provide unique UV sensitivity (0.31--1 $\mu$m compared to
% 0.38--1.25 $\mu$m with PFS), and offer higher-density, more flexible
% target sampling over ``deep-drilling'' fields.  Unlike PFS, FOBOS would be operated
% on a U.S.\ telescope with dedicated U.S.\ access and a commitment to
% supporting U.S.-led imaging facilities.  FOBOS is also complementary to
% future telescopes and instruments that would be optimized to cover wider areas
% (several deg$^2$ per pointing) at shallower depths.

%\comment{mention FOBOS can do PI-led science too}

% The need for deep spectroscopic follow-up is particularly acute for the major cosmological probes to be carried out by
% LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST, which all rely on ``photometric redshifts:'' measures of galaxy redshift, $z$
% --- a direct proxy of distance and look-back time---based on imaging alone. \citet{newman15} summarize the case for a
%     significant spectroscopic campaign to calibrate and train LSST photometric redshifts in order to improve cosmological constraints.  They describe a redshift survey that,
%     if carried out with FOBOS, would increase LSST's Dark Energy figure-of-merit by 40\% at a cost of less than 5\% of
%     the LSST budget.  The urgent case for spectroscopic redshift training has been the subject of numerous publications
%     \citep[e.g.,][]{laureijs11, masters15, hemmati18}.

% Meanwhile, the astronomy community recognizes that the coming ``Big
% Data'' era, culminating in LSST, necessitates ``\textbf{harnessing the
% data revolution}.''  Widespread community interest in advanced
% data-science techniques continues to grow amidst calls for educational
% programs, conference series, and research funding to support the growth
% of a new field, ``Astroinformatics,'' which exploits the interface
% between astrophysics and statistics \citep{borne09}.  Astronomy's
% largest organizations, including the American Astronomical Society and
% the International Astronomical Union, have supported active working
% groups on astroinformatics and astrostatistics since 2015.  LSST itself
% has supported the Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration and
% partnered with NSF on the Data Science Fellowship Program to train
% astronomy graduate students in data-science techniques.  Our proposal
% builds on and contributes to these ongoing efforts.

risk levels to 1) Starbugs positioners (adhesion and control), 2)
Micro fore-optics at the fiber input (alignment and process control),
3) Calibration system performance (uniformity and stability).

\noindent \textbf{Focal Plane System.} Mounted at the Nasmyth focus
of Keck II Telescope at WMKO (Fig \ref{fig:layout}), FOBOS is a
modular instrument composed of several major systems. Telescope light
passes through the first two 946 mm diameter lenses of a 3-lens
compensating lateral atmospheric dispersion corrector (CLADC) before
encountering a 45$^\circ$ mirror that folds the beam vertically
upwards. The horizontal 3rd lens of the CLADC is positioned at focus
above the fold mirror and serves as the mounting plate for a
complement of Starbugs that roam its upper surface, positioning
downward-pointing fibers on desired targets. The risk of Starbugs
adhesion loss and drops is significantly reduced by the fixed
horizontal focal surface, which preserves a normal gravity vector for
the Starbugs and, because they are mounted on top, reduces each bugs'
vacuum adhesion requirements. The focal surface rotates as the
telescope tracks. Starbugs can patrol zones up to several arcminutes
and can be placed as close as 10\arcsec{}. Back illumination combined
with a fast, imaging metrology camera enables reconfiguration times
down to 2 minutes.

%   \item[] \emph{Proposed Work}: $\bullet$ CLADC opto-mechanical system through PDR $\bullet$ Starbugs system implementation through PDR 

% \end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Spectrographs.} Three spectrographs adjacent to the
focal plane module are fed by a short ($< 10$m) stress-relieving
fiber run in order to preserve UV throughput. Each spectrograph uses
dichroics to divide the 140 mm diameter collimated beam into four
wavelength channels with combined, instantaneous coverage from
0.31--1 $\mu$m. Fused-silica etched (FSE) gratings provide
mid-channel spectral resolutions of $R \sim 3500$ at high diffraction
efficiency in each channel. The dispersed light is focused by f/2.25
refractive cameras\footnote{Based on the camera design for the DESI
spectrographs.} and recorded by 6k$\times$6k CCDs with 15 $\mu$m
pixels and 5-pixel sampling of the fiber diameter. The spectrographs
are mounted in a temperature-controlled housing on the Nasmyth Deck.
The estimated end-to-end instrument throughput peaks at 60\% and is
greater than 30\% at all wavelengths.

\noindent \textbf{Focal Plane Sampling.} FOBOS deploys a total of
1800 fibers. Fore-optics on the front end of each fiber demagnify and
speed up the beam (from f/15 to f/5 \comment{f/5 or f/3ish ?}) for
better coupling to the fiber numerical aperture and to minimize
losses from focal-ratio degradation (microlens arrays accomplish this
for the fiber bundles). The nominal sky sampling of each fiber is
0.8\arcsec{} (diameter). A day-time procedure switches between
different targeting modes for each spectrograph: 1) individual
fibers, 600 per spectrograph; 2) A set of 15 multiplexed fiber-bundle
IFUs (per spectrograph), each composed of 37 fibers and spanning up
to 5.6\arcsec{}; 3) A 30\arcsec{}-wide monolithic IFU (1641 fibers).
In all cases, $\sim$10\% of individual fibers are reserved for sky
sampling and 5--10 7-fiber mini-bundles collect standard stars for
instantaneous flux calibration. The design will accept and take
advantage of ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO) corrections should a
GLAO system be deployed at Keck II.

\noindent \textbf{Calibration System.} Stability and the limitation
of potential instrument systematics demand a precise calibration
system. Afternoon flat-field and arc-line exposures will use a
carefully-illuminated interior dome screen. Nighttime calibrations
involve rotating the fold mirror towards a pupil-injection system
adjacent to the focal-plane module. Absolute flat-field measurements
in the afternoon and relative fiber-to-fiber measurements from
nighttime calibrations will be combined to model the instrument$+$sky
response during observations.

\noindent \textbf{Data Management System.} All software related to
observational planning, data collection, processing, and serving. An
API communicates between the following major sub-systems. {\bf The
Doctor}: A database of metadata and performance metrics, as well as
analysis software, to monitor instrument health and predict
performance. {\bf The Producer}: Planning, simulation, and execution
of integrated, multiple-pointing observing programs based on {\it
MAISTRO}\footnote{MAISTRO: Modular Artificial Intelligence System for
Target Reallocation and Observing.}, an ``artificial intelligence''
(AI) targeting system that will learn optimization strategies for
assigning targets defined by the Lead Observer, as well as a database
containing overlapping and prioritized programs. {\bf The
Accountant}: A data-reduction pipeline with runtime options for both
quick-look and science-ready reductions. {\bf The Alchemist}:
Automated derivation of high-level data products (e.g., redshifts).
{\bf The Curator}: An archive of all data and data products as well
as a dynamic interface and science platform for visualization and
analysis.

% \noindent \textbf{MAISTRO: Target Allocation with Artificial Intelligence} Powered by Starbugs fiber positioners, FOBOS will enable fast, dynamic
% reallocation of fibers.  To efficiently determine the best options given
% a wide range of possible targets and desired observing outcomes, we will
% develop a preliminary design for MAISTRO\footnote{MAISTRO: Modular
% Artificial Intelligence System for Target Reallocation and Observing.}
% an ``artificial intelligence'' (AI) targeting system that will learn
% optimization strategies for assigning targets from a database of
% overlapping observing programs with pre-defined priorities.  The AI
% package will aggregate data quality using a quick-look reduction
% package, science-driven performance metrics, {\it and real-time
% assessments of the observing conditions} to make dynamic targeting
% recommendations.  For example, if conditions are slightly less than
% optimal, MAISTRO would reconfigure Starbugs to brighter objects in a
% field or implement a different program prioritization.  MAISTRO will
% incorporate updated target lists and priorities from the active observer
% and could easily be over-ridden at any time.   Fractions of the full
% FOBOS multiplex might also be reserved ``manual targeting'' as required
% by the program PI.  

%   - maintains a database with observational progress on individual
%     targets in the survey and
%   - dynamically reallocates fibers based on real-time assessments of
%     the aggregate S/N of each target to meet the specific need of each
%     science case.

% This requires significant design and testing of a combined software
% package and hardware interface.  Specific considerations involve (1)
% fast and robust reduction procedures (cf. MaNGA DOS) that can assess
% the aggregate data and (2) a responsive database with a schema
% optimized for real-time decision making to select targets for
% (re)acquisition while accounting for collision limitations.  Provided
% enough design effort, this lends itself to a machine-learning
% application.

\section{Broader Impacts and Student Training}
\label{sec:bi}

\subsection{Akamai: Training the next generation of Hawaiian STEM
professionals} Led by the Institute for Scientist and Engineer
Educators (ISEE) at UCSC, the Akamai Internship Program is aimed at
advancing college students from Hawai'i into the STEM workforce.
Almost 400 students have participated to date, of which 24\% are
Native Hawaiian and 38\% are women. A longitudinal study of Akamai
outcomes indicated that 87\% were still in STEM, either in the
workforce or continuing STEM studies \citep{asee_peer_31030}. ISEE
and the Akamai program already have deep connections to WMKO; 45
interns have worked on projects related to instrument development and
observatory operations over the past 15 years. Our funding request
includes support for a total of eight Akamai interns (four per
year).\footnote{
%
Kupke, MacDonald, and Westfall have all mentored Akamai interns at
UCO, including one who helped build a fiber test-bench at UCSC during
Summer 2018.} We aim to support students hosted at UCO, Berkeley/SSL,
and WMKO in development of our fiber-testing facilities, the
opto-mechanical design of the ADC and spectrographs, and the design
of our data-management systems.

% One intern will develop aspects of the FOBOS instrument simulator and
% use this simulator to develop performance metrics for the Preliminary
% Design. The second will build machine-learning tools for Data-Science
% Challenge \ref{lowsnr}, specifically for obtaining spectroscopic
% redshifts at low S/N.

\subsection{Investing in future educators} Also via the ISEE, we will
support four graduate students (two per year) to participate in the
Professional Development Program (PDP) that build teaching skills
through collaborative design of an inquiry activity. The PDP team
conceives, develops, and tests the activity which culminates in a lab
exercise run with undergraduates. The program emphasizes inclusive
and equitable learning environments. Specifically, our team of
graduate students will develop a lab unit related to FOBOS instrument
development aimed at incoming community college transfer students
enrolled in UCSC's highly-successful Lamat Program. In addition to
enriching graduate student training, these efforts will positively
impact 25 undergraduates from California community colleges, a large
fraction from underrepresented minority groups.

\subsection{Student Training} UCSC's {\bf Astro 9} course introduces
scientific research methods to 1st-year students by engaging small
student teams on actual research projects supervised by graduate
students, postdocs, and staff. The {\bf Science Internship Program}
(SIP) creates a similar environment for high-school students over a
10 week summer program. We will design projects for both programs
focused on simulating data sets and introducing machine learning
concepts used in our Data Science Challenges. Both PI Bundy and co-PI
Westfall have served as research mentors in these programs.

\section{Project Management}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip -0.1in
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Pre-Proposal_Project_figure.jpg}
\caption{\small Microsoft Project plan WBS and schedule.}
\label{fig:gantt}
\end{figure}

To maximize synergy with LSST and WFIRST, we have crafted an
aggressive project plan (Figure \ref{fig:gantt}) that enables
first-light in 2028. Our plan envisions a Preliminary Design Review
in 2022, which motivates a subsequent MSIP request that year for
Final Design funding. A ``bridge phase'' (2022-2023) continues
development of critical long-lead sub-systems, that if put on hold,
would delay first-light. Other private and future NSF solicitations
(MSRI in 2023), in addition to funding from our Australian partners
(through the LIEF program), provide opportunities to complete the
FOBOS design and initial construction phases.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.65\textwidth}\small
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figs/org_chart_v1.pdf}
\caption{Management sturcture.}
\label{fig:org}
\end{wrapfigure}

Our management structure is presented in Figure \ref{fig:org}. With
Bundy as PI, overall project management is provided by MacDonald, and
Westfall (Project Scientist) leads science definition and the science
team. Two Instrument Scientist positions oversee the front-facing
(focal plane and fibers) and back-facing (spectrographs and
detectors) modules. Our project management controls framework builds
from low-level task lists for each WBS element to an integrated
resource-loaded project plan that tracks schedule, cash flow, and
earned value on a quarterly basis. Project leads at each
participating institution maintain individual schedules and budgets
and report progress to the Project Manager. We hold 20\% contingency
as appropriate for Preliminary Design. Contingency and budget
estimation processes are defined in our PEP.

% FOBOS has a detailed Project Management Plan (PEP) which follows guidelines outlined in Section 3 of the NSF Major Facilities Guide (NSF 19-XX Dec 2018).  The PEP is outlined at Level 1 for this pre-proposal.  Level one PEP outlines is as follows; 1. Introduction, 2.  Organization, 3.  Design and Development, 4.  Contraction project definition, 5.  Staffing, 6.  Risk and Opportunity Management, 6.  Systems Engineering, 7.  Configuration and Controls, 8.  Acquisitions, 9.  Project Management Controls, 10.  Site and Environment, 11.  Cyber-infrastructure, 12.  Environmental Safety and Health Plans, 13.  Reviews and Reporting, 14.  Commissioning, 15.  Project Closeout plan

% Project management controls for this and future project phases is accomplished by low level task lists which are used to develop resource loaded schedules for determining both cost and duration.  This ‘bottom up’ approach allows for a detailed accounting of project cost and cash flow.  It allows for in process tracking trough earned value reporting, earned value will be calculated a minimum quarterly or when deemed necessary by the Project Manager.  Each sub-award institution is responsible for maintaining their own schedule and budget as well as reported earned value to the Project Manager.  A detailed Work Breakdown and Product Breakdown structure is in place to insure clear understand scope of delivered work and to insure well documented interfaces between systems.

% Contingency for this proposal, funding of preliminary design, is set at 20\%.  As the project develops the contingency on future work and equipment will be set using a combination of basis of estimate and associated risk.  The process for contingency estimation is included in the detailed PEP.
