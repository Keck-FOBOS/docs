\section{Proposed Work}
\label{sec:design}

FOBOS will complete its current conceptual design phase in fall 2019. Funding from this proposal will support the next
phase of Preliminary Design.  A schedule of milestones and additional information is provided in the Project
Execution Plan (PEP).  Major components of the Preliminary Design effort are described below.

\noindent \textbf{Atmospheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC):} The
opto-mechanical design, tolerancing, lens cell design, motion systems,
and software-control design of the ADC will be completed.  

\noindent \textbf{Focal Plane System:} Mechanical design, including flexure analysis and
the selection of drive mechanisms and potential vendors will be
completed.  This system also defines one of the interfaces to the Keck
II Telescope and must comply with WMKO space envelopes, servicing needs,
and other requirements.  The focal plane system also inputs the
guide cameras.

\noindent \textbf{Starbugs fiber positioners:} Starbugs are a
positioning technology developed and deployed by the Australian
Astronomical Observatory (AAO), which has partnered with our team to
generate a conceptual design for use of Starbugs by FOBOS.  Design
requirements for Starbugs in FOBOS are more relaxed than the currently
on-sky TAIPAN instrument thanks to the larger physical plate scale at
Keck.  

\noindent \textbf{Fiber System:} We will complete the optical design and
processing plan for affixing forward optics lenses to each fiber head.  A
micro-lens array solution will be developed for a central,
fixed-position 4.5-arcsec diameter IFU for fast source acquisition. This
work package also inputs the stress-relief cable system and fiber
termination hardware and processing.

\noindent \textbf{Spectrographs.} The optical systems and components
(slit, collimator, dichroics, gratings, and camera), an analysis of
acceptable tolerances and performance, their mechanical supports,
software controls, and the overall enclosure will all be advanced
through Preliminary Design.  Detectors, cryostats, read-out electronics
and systems for thermal management will be designed.

% Put the calibration system back in?
% \noindent \textbf{Calibration System.} This package inputs design of an interior dome screen and projection system for injecting calibration sources with sufficient spatial uniformity and stability into the instrument.  We will work with the Observatory to develop an integration and controls plan.  No such calibration system currently exists at Keck.

% \noindent \textbf{Auxiliary Systems.} Design of auxiliary systems inputs Nasmyth platform interfaces, utilities access, fiber routing and support, thermal control and vibration control systems.

\subsection{MAISTRO: Target Allocation with Artificial Intelligence}
\label{sec:targeting}

Powered by Starbugs fiber positioners, FOBOS will enable fast, dynamic
reallocation of fibers.  To efficiently determine the best options given
a wide range of possible targets and desired observing outcomes, we will
develop a preliminary design for MAISTRO,\footnote{MAISTRO: Modular
Artificial Intelligence System for Target Reallocation and Observing.}
an ``artificial intelligence'' (AI) targeting system that will learn
optimization strategies for assigning targets from a database of
overlapping observing programs with pre-defined priorities.  The AI
package will aggregate data quality using a quick-look reduction
package, science-driven performance metrics, {\it and real-time
assessments of the observing conditions} to make dynamic targeting
recommendations.  For example, if conditions are slightly less than
optimal, MAISTRO would reconfigure Starbugs to brighter objects in a
field or implement a different program prioritization.  MAISTRO will
incorporate updated target lists and priorities from the active observer
and could easily be over-ridden at any time.   Fractions of the full
FOBOS multiplex might also be reserved ``manual targeting'' as required
by the program PI.  

%   - maintains a database with observational progress on individual
%     targets in the survey and
%   - dynamically reallocates fibers based on real-time assessments of
%     the aggregate S/N of each target to meet the specific need of each
%     science case.

% This requires significant design and testing of a combined software
% package and hardware interface.  Specific considerations involve (1)
% fast and robust reduction procedures (cf. MaNGA DOS) that can assess
% the aggregate data and (2) a responsive database with a schema
% optimized for real-time decision making to select targets for
% (re)acquisition while accounting for collision limitations.  Provided
% enough design effort, this lends itself to a machine-learning
% application.


\subsection{Automated Data Products}
\label{sec:DAP}

While the FOBOS data simulator is required for our data-science challenges, it also forms the basis of a delivered data
reduction pipeline (DRP) for this instrument.  This software will provide both the quick reduction assessments needed
for dynamic targeting, as well as full reductions for scientific analysis.  In the proposal period, we will also
develop a preliminary design for a data analysis pipeline (DAP).  Unique among Keck instruments, the FOBOS DAP will
take advantage of the fixed spectral format and common target classes to provide high-level data products, including
Doppler shift, emission-line strengths, and template continuum fits (cf., Westfall et al.; SDSS-IV MaNGA DAP).  The DAP
will also produce results from relevant machine-learning applications (e.g., redshifts at low-S/N).

Raw data, reduced spectra, and high-level DAP science products will be
publicly delivered via user-friendly platforms built on the Keck Observatory Archive.  After associated
proprietary periods, data will be served for {\it all} FOBOS observations, creating a rich legacy data set for the astronomical community.  Both program PIs
and the larger community will be encouraged to develop the DRP and DAP
to meet the needs of specific science applications.  These software
packages will be open source and publicly served (e.g., using GitHub).
