\section*{Executive Summary}

% - Summarize your science objectives and your technical implementation at
%   a high level.

\noindent{\bf Science objectives:} FOBOS, the Fiber-Optic Broadband
Optical Spectrograph, is a facility-class, general-purpose
spectrograph for the 10m Keck II telescope. It emphasizes UV
sensitivity (up to the atmospheric limit), high multiplex, multiple
focal-plane sampling formats, and near Poissonian-level performance
over extremely long ($\sim$100 hr) integration times. These emphases
establish FOBOS's uniqueness among the suite of spectrographs coming
online for 8-10m class telescopes in the next decade. FOBOS is
specifically built to enable the deep spectroscopic follow-up of
upcoming large-scale imaging surveys (LSST, WFIRST, and Euclid)
identified as a significant need of the astronomy community in the US
and beyond. For example, capitalizing on the combined $\approx$\$4B
the US is investing in these imaging surveys, FOBOS can increase
LSST's dark-energy figure-of-merit by 40\% (Newman et al.\ 2015).

\smallskip

\noindent{\bf Technical implementation:} FOBOS is a fiber-fed,
fixed-format spectrograph. Its primary systems include (1) a
compensating lateral atmospheric dispersion corrector (CLADC), (2) a
robotic fiber-positioning system based on AAO's Starbug technology,
(3) micro-assembly fore-optics required to optimally couple the Keck
II input beam to the fiber feed, (4) 10m-long fiber trains that
provide at least three focal-plane sampling options (single fibers,
multiple small IFUs, and a single large-format IFU), and (5) a bank
of three 4-channel spectrographs that provide a simultanous spectral
range of 0.31-1 $\mu$m at a resolution of $R\sim3500$ across the full
band.

\smallskip

% - Summarize the technology maturity of your implementation, listing the
%   demonstrated technologies and the technologies requiring development.

\noindent{\bf Technological maturity:} FOBOS is nearing the end of
its conceptual design phase, and will begin its preliminary design
phase in Oct 2020, contingent on funding. Components of this document
represent significant improvements in FOBOS's design since the
completion of our Astro2020 submission. Although requiring
significant design work, FOBOS's backend systems are built on
well-established technologies: FOBOS's spectrographs and fiber train
inherit significantly from SDSS, MaNGA, and DESI designs. FOBOS's
front-end leverages the more than 15 years of development of the
Starbugs position system, which have been deployed and are in the
final commissioning stages for the TAIPAN instrument on the AAT.
Further development of the Starbugs technology is needed for use in
FOBOS; however this represents a 2nd-generation implementation of the
technology and will leverage simultaneous development of the
GMT/MANIFEST instrument. Further development of the micro-assembly
fore-optics is also necessary; prototypes are currently being
developed with potential industry partners and tested at UCO/UCB.

% - Summarize areas where the data to support this RFI are not currently
%   available.

\noindent{\bf Limitations of this RFI:} Given this early stage in
development, particular project components with limited extant
data/information to address this RFI are as follows:
