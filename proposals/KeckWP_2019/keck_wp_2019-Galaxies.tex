\subsection{Globular cluster tracers}

Globular clusters and (GCs) and planetary nebulae are valuable
chemodynamical tracers of the outskirts of nearby galaxies, but they are
difficult targets for current instruments because they are sparsely
distributed. FOBOS will be a game changer in this area. For dynamical
studies of nearby galaxies with $\mathcal{M_\ast/M_\odot} \lesssim
10^{11}$, which typically host $\lesssim1500$ GCs
\citep{2013ApJ...772...82H}, FOBOS makes it possible to acquire
spectra for nearly all GCs located within $\sim$50 kpc from the host
galaxy in a single night. These data will allow us to map the
chemodynamics of massive galaxy halos and infer orbital families as a
function of stellar-population properties. Additionally, these data
will inform models of GC formation in the context of the larger
galaxy population.

% \subsection{Cluster galaxy populations}

% Presently, it is very expensive to conduct systematic spectroscopic
% studies of the various galaxy types in rich galaxy clusters, like
% Coma, due to their angular spread on the sky. With FOBOS's flexible
% fiber-positioning system and 17-arcminute FOV, it will be possible to
% simultaneously (and efficiently) build up an unprecedented library of
% spectroscopic redshifts and stellar-population parameters of galaxies
% in clusters towards intermediate redshift. Follow-up FOBOS
% observations using its deployable mini-IFUs will allow us to
% simultaneously obtain resolved spectroscopy for 10s of these cluster
% galaxies, enabling us to associate internal structures/properties of
% the galaxies with their host cluster.

\subsection{Internal structure of high-$z$ galaxies}

MaNGA \citep{bundy15} and other large IFU surveys are defining the
$z=0$ benchmark for how internal structure is organized across the
galaxy population. To understand and test ideas for how this internal
structure emerged, we require spatially-resolved observations at $z =
1$--2, just after the peak formation epoch. Indeed, Keck has
pioneered such observations \citep[e.g.,][]{erb04, miller11,law09},
but samples have been limited to a few hundred sources. FOBOS in
multiplex IFU-mode will obtain resolved spectroscopy for thousands of
galaxies. Bright optical emission line tracers will reveal gas-phase
structure and kinematics across unprecedented numbers of early
galaxies. Stacking restframe $\lambda \approx 4500$ spectra will
enable radial stellar population analyses to constrain how stellar
components formed and assembled. While initially limited to coarse
spatial scales, ground-layer adaptive optics (GLAO) in combination with FOBOS would be
transformative for this science. A corrected FWHM of 0.2-0.3 arcsec
would enable fine-sampling IFUs to probe smaller galaxies and study
sub-structure on 1--2 kpc scales.

\subsection{Role of environment at $z=1$--$2$ }

The vast increase in multiplex and high
sampling density will allow FOBOS to map out environmental effects on galaxy evolution at
the group scale ($\mathcal{M_\ast/M_\odot} \lesssim 10^{13}$), and
with sufficient exposure time, for tens of thousands of satellites
down to sub-L$^*$ luminosities. Taking this a step further thanks to
deep, wide-field imaging surveys (e.g., LSST), a 1M-object environmental survey at $z=1$--$2$ may be possible. The
goal is to use improved photo-$z$s, strong priors on spectral types,
and new machine-learning techniques to deliver {\it spectroscopic}
redshifts (with $\lesssim$300 km/s accuracy) at the lowest
signal-to-noise possible, reducing required exposure times by factors of 4--5.

\subsection{The galaxy ecosystem at $z$$\sim$2}
\label{sec:z2galaxies}

With surveys like MOSDEF \citep{kriek15} and KBSS \citep[e.g.,][]{steidel14}, MOSFIRE has provided powerful new
insights into early galaxies at the $z \sim 2$ peak formation epoch.  A complete picture of the galaxy ``ecosystem'' at
this key epoch, however, must include their gas-filled environments as well.  Using Ly$\alpha$ absorption in background
galaxies, a tomographic map of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in regions surveyed by MOSDEF and KBSS is a key first
step. Its promise and application was demonstrated at Keck by \citet{lee14}, which motivates FOBOS's UV sensitivity,
target flexibility and multiplex in service of tomographic mapping of large-scale structure, including protoclusters
\citep{lee16}, voids \citep{krolewski18}, and filaments \citep{horowitz19}.  \citet{2018arXiv181005156S} take IGM
tomography in a new direction, demonstrating with simulated observations that quasar ``light echos,'' spatial
signatures of the expanding ionization front of a newly activated quasar, can be detected and used to infer opening
angles and deconstruct the quasar's accretion history (see Fig \ref{fig:LightEcho}).  The required FOBOS spectra can simultaneously constrain the C IV mass density (via $\lambda\lambda$ 1548, 1550 \AA) and patterns of C IV enrichment on both IGM and cicumgalactic scales, revealing the imprint of galaxy fueling and feedback processes \citep[e.g.,][]{tumlinson17}.

% From George:
% - fill out case for probing both galaxies and their “gas-filled
%   environments”
%    - make it more explicit that getting large numbers of redshifts
%      would make it possible to trace out large-scale structure in
%      detail
%    - enables studies of galaxy properties as a function of environment
%
% - also mention targeting galaxies along QSO lines of sight
%    - much higher target density than with LRIS, DEIMOS over larger FOV.
%
% - Worth discussing Lyman-alpha or metal-line tomography?  
%
% - More quantitative comparisons with existing data sets?
%    - What key science questions can FOBOS address that many years of
%      LRIS and DEIMOS observations have not been able to?  Surely some
%      level of the spectral tagging and photo-z training can be done
%      (and surely is being done) with existing data.  Is FOBOS going to
%      be a huge leap, or will it mainly be cleaning up neglected corners
%      of parameter space?
%
% - More excited to hear about how the FOBOS spectra will be used for
%   science directly, instead of support for LSST
