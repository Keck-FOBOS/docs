\end{center}

\smallskip

\noindent We have built a strong team of astronomers and engineers
critical to the success of our project, as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Kevin Bundy (UCO)} is the Principle Investigator, responsible
for the overall leadership of the project.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Kyle Westfall (UCO)} is the Project Scientist, responsible
for continued development and refinement of FOBOS's science
requirements, including coordinating our science-team efforts.  Westfall
will also lead our data-systems development.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Nicholas MacDonald (UCO)} is the Chief Engineer, responsible
for leading the optomechanical design of the instrument and working with
WMKO staff to ensure successful deployment of FOBOS on the Keck II
telescope.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Maureen Savage (UCO)} is the Project Manager, responsible for
maintaining our development schedule and budget.  She coordinates
development of the full project work breakdown structure and project
documentation.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Renate Kupke (UCO)} is the Instrument Scientist, responsible
for the optical design of our multi-channel spectrographs and ensures
that the full optical system meets the science requirements.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf John O'Meara (WMKO)} is the Chief Scientist for the
W.~M.~Keck Observatory.  He will coordinate with the Project Scientist
(Westfall) to ensure that the science requirements of FOBOS also meet
the larger scientific goals of WMKO.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Marc Kassis (WMKO)} is the instrument program manager at
W.~M.~Keck Observatory.  He coordinates instrument development for the
WMKO as a whole.  He will coordinate with the FOBOS instrument team and
the WMKO staff regarding the FOBOS design and telescope-integration
plan, given the full scope of Keck's development projects.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Jon Lawrence (AAO)} is Head of Technology at the Australian
Astronomical Observatory and integral to the development of the Starbugs
technology.  He and his team, with additional optical design
consultations from {\bf Will Saunders (AAO)}, will complete their design
of the FOBOS Starbugs system.\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Lisa Hunter (UCSC)} is the Director of Institute for
Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE) and Director of the Akamai
Workforce Initiative (AWI) at the University of Hawai'i Institute for
Astronomy.  She will work with the instrument-development and science
teams to organize our Akamai internships and Professional Development
Programs.
%
\end{itemize}

\noindent In addition to the instrument-development team, we have convened three
science teams, one for each of the main science themes of our proposal:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
\item {\bf Dark-Energy Science Team}: Peter Capak (CalTech), Rachel
Mandelbaum (CMU), Dan Masters (JPL), Jeffrey Newman (Pitt), Markus
Michael Rau (CMU), and Jason Rhodes (JPL).\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Proto-Galaxy Ecosystem Science Team}: George Becker (UCR),
Alison Coil (UCSD), Michael Cooper (UCI), Brian Siana (UCR), J. Xavier
Prochaska (UCSC), Alice Shapley (UCLA), and Gillian Wilson
(UCR).\\[-10pt]
%
\item {\bf Local Group Science Team}: Puragra Guhathakurta (UCSC), R.
Michael Rich (UCLA), Connie Rockosi (UCSC), Laura Sales (UCR), Daniel
Weisz (UCB), and Yuan-Sen Ting (Princeton).

\end{itemize}
