\section*{Executive Summary}
%\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}

% Soon, our community will be inundated with sources of interest from
% large-scale ground- and space-based surveys requiring spectroscopic
% follow-up for physical characterization. In fact, with the recent
% {\it Gaia} releases, the spectroscopic needs in Galactic Astronomy
% are already dire, a situation that will be acutely felt by
% extragalactic community once LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST begin
% delivering data. These sources will span the full range of scientific
% interests of our current Keck partners and Keck's current
% spectroscopic capabilities will not e sufficient to meet these needs.

The 2016 Keck Observatory Scientific Strategic Plan lists
highly-multiplexed spectroscopy as a key desirable that would
position Keck to take advantage of the coming era of wide-field
imaging facilities like LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. FOBOS addresses
this priority via a fiber-based facility that optimizes depth over
area, preserving Keck's historical strength in faint-object
spectroscopy. The result is a uniquely blue-sensitive, high-multiplex
instrument with order-of-magnitude greater sampling density than
competitors like Subaru's Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). In the LSST
era, FOBOS will excel at building the deep, spectroscopic reference
data sets needed to interpret vast imaging data. At the same time,
its flexible focal plane, including deployable integral-field units
(IFUs), enables an expansive range of scientific investigations from
the diverse Keck community.

FOBOS is a modular instrument composed of three major components: (1)
an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) whose final lens traces the
Nasmyth focal surface, (2) a flexible focal-plane sampling system
that deploys as many as 1800 free-roaming Starbug positioners that
``walk'' on this surface to sample a 17-arcminute diameter field, and
(3) a bank of three temperature-controlled bench spectrographs
mounted on the Nasmyth platform that provide $R \sim 3500$
spectroscopy over an instantaneous bandpass of 0.31-1$\mu$m. The
spectrographs are fed light from the focal plane by a short fiber run
($<$10 m) through a stress-relief cabling system to minimize
throughput losses (see diagram above).

The focal-plane system is designed to allow for flexible targeting
and multiple sampling formats. When configured in its single-fiber
mode, each Starbug carries a single optical fiber with a 150 $\mu$m
diameter core fed by demagnifying fore-optics that sample a
0.9-arcsec diameter on-sky aperture. When configured in multi-IFU
mode, FOBOS deploys a different suite of Starbugs carrying fiber
bundles with coupled lenslet arrays that provide finer spatial
sampling.  Its flexible focal
plane allows efficient observing strategies that combine multiple
programs and can dynamically respond to changing conditions and
targets of opportunity.

% Finally, a monolithic-IFU mode provides uniform coverage
% over a $\gtrsim$0.5 arcmin$^2$ field-of-view.

Its UV sensitivity, high multiplex and sampling density, multiple
focal-plane sampling options, and flexible targeting system make
FOBOS compelling in science areas that are both traditional strengths
of the Keck Community and unique among the capabilities of
forthcoming spectroscopic facilities. Science cases discussed in
Section \ref{sec:goals} include: Local Group archeology via resolved
stellar spectra in dwarf galaxies, M31, and the Milky Way halo;
globular-cluster populations of individual galaxies and Coma-like
galaxy clusters; new probes of galaxies, their environments, and the
evolution of both since $z \sim 1$ including kinematic studies of
winds, resolved gas-phase properties and dynamics of star-forming
galaxies, and the internal structure of stellar populations for large
samples of distant galaxies; detailed tomographic Ly-$\alpha$ and
UV-absorption-line measurements of galaxies and the intergalactic
medium at $z \sim 2$--4; direct, spectroscopy redshifts critical to
the success of cosmological analyses based on photo-$z$ measurements
from panoramic deep imaging (e.g., LSST); and rapid follow-up of
transient sources with a dedicated fixed IFU at the field center.

This Keck White Paper proposal requests Phase-A funding to complete conceptual design, develop cost estimates, plan for upcoming NSF and other funding opportunities, and advance solutions to high-risk design elements.  

% FOBOS enables Local Group archeology studies via resolved stellar
% spectra at moderate spectral resolution in dwarf galaxies, M31, and
% the Milky Way halo. At greater distances, FOBOS will compile powerful
% statistics for the globular-cluster populations of individual
% galaxies and Coma-like galaxy clusters. FOBOS's combined depth and
% high sampling density allow for new probes of galaxies, their
% environments, and a their mutual evolution from $z \sim 1$.
% Specifically when using its IFU mode, FOBOS will enable kinematic
% studies of winds, the resolved gas-phase properties and dynamics of
% star-forming galaxies, and the internal structure of stellar
% populations for large samples of distant galaxies. FOBOS's capacity
% for detailed tomographic Ly-$\alpha$ and UV-absorption-line
% measurements of galaxies and the intergalactic medium at $z \sim
% 2$--4 will be unparalleled. Cosmological analyses using panoramic
% deep imaging (e.g., LSST) will greatly benefit from photo-$z$
% training by FOBOS, which is ideally suited to required photo-$z$
% programs. Finally, with a dedicated IFU always ready, FOBOS can
% rapidly follow up transient sources while continuing to collect
% valuable photons on background targets.



% High-multiplex and deep spectroscopic followup of LSST and other
% panoramic deep-imaging surveys is a widely recognized necessity.
% Reports in 2015 and 2016 by the National Research Council and
% National Optical Astronomical Observatory specifically recommended
% investment in new spectroscopic facilities to meet these needs
% because none currently exist or are planned for U.S.\ observatories.
% We seek seed funding from WMKO to continue conceptual design of
% FOBOS, a powerful new spectrograph for the Keck II telescope that increases its current survey speed by a factor of X.

% Led by NSF's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\footnote{
% %
% LSST will be begin science operations in 2023.}
% %
% (LSST), astronomy is entering a new era of unprecedented deep-imaging data sets that will survey huge volumes of the
% Universe.  From the emergence of the earliest galaxies from a ``primordial soup'' of gas and dust, to the peak of
% cosmic star formation and the current era of accelerated expansion, these surveys will provide unprecedented statistics
% at key epochs of cosmic history.


% Even so, gaining physical insight from panoramic imaging surveys will require intensive spectroscopic follow-up.  The
% power of combining photometry and dedicated spectroscopy is widely appreciated and perhaps best illustrated by the
% success of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) which used this combination to record the properties of over 1 million
% galaxies, mapping the present-day universe and making SDSS one of the most highly cited surveys in the history of
% astronomy.

% LSST's all-sky images will be 1,000 times deeper and detect far more
% distant galaxies than SDSS, but \textbf{no current U.S. facility is
% capable of obtaining spectroscopic follow-up of LSST galaxies} at a level
% required to capitalize on the \$1B the U.S.\ has invested in that
% project.  In fact, an SDSS-like spectroscopic study of 1 million
% galaxies at LSST depth would require 300 years of observing on the
% largest telescopes with current instrumentation!  

% Solving this problem requires not only more powerful spectroscopic facilities, but new ways to take better advantage of
% what will be necessarily more limited spectroscopy compared to the vast imaging surveys of the LSST era.  The more
% promising path is encapsulated in one of NSF's ``10 Big Ideas,'' \emph{Harnessing the Data Revolution}: we can maximize
% the information content of LSST and other imaging facilities via machine learning from optimally designed spectroscopic
% training sets.


% The need for spectroscopic follow-up in the LSST era was made clear in
% the National Research Council's 2015 report, ``Optimizing the U.S.
% Ground-Based Optical and Infrared Astronomy System'' \citep{NAP21722}:

% The National Science Foundation should support the development of a
% wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability on a medium- or
% large-aperture telescope in the Southern Hemisphere to enable a wide
% variety of science, including follow-up spectroscopy of Large Synoptic
% Survey Telescope targets. Examples of enabled science are studies of
% cosmology, galaxy evolution, quasars, and the Milky Way.

% Workshops organized by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO)
% in 2013 and 2016, the latter at the NSF's request, reported specific
% spectroscopic needs for LSST follow-up in all science areas.  In
% particular, the 2016 report notes that a critical resource in need of
% prompt development is to ``Develop or obtain access to a highly
% multiplexed, wide-field optical multi-object spectroscopic capability on
% an 8m-class telescope.''  Based on these recommendations, we propose the
% FOBOS instrument coupled with a suite of data-driven tools to address
% the spectroscopic requirements of LSST and other photometric surveys at
% a final cost 20 times less than a new Southern Hemisphere facility.
% Located in Hawaii, FOBOS can access more than 70\% of the LSST
% footprint, more than adequate for building powerful
% spectroscopic training sets.  Compared to the Prime Focus Spectrograph
% (PFS) on Japan's Subaru Telescope, FOBOS would be 1.7$\times$ faster,
% provide unique UV sensitivity (0.31--1 $\mu$m compared to
% 0.38--1.25 $\mu$m with PFS), and offer higher-density, more flexible
% target sampling over ``deep-drilling'' fields.  Unlike PFS, FOBOS would be operated
% on a U.S.\ telescope with dedicated U.S.\ access and a commitment to
% supporting U.S.-led imaging facilities.  FOBOS is also complementary to
% future telescopes and instruments that would be optimized to cover wider areas
% (several deg$^2$ per pointing) at shallower depths.

%\comment{mention FOBOS can do PI-led science too}

% The need for deep spectroscopic follow-up is particularly acute for the major cosmological probes to be carried out by
% LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST, which all rely on ``photometric redshifts:'' measures of galaxy redshift, $z$
% --- a direct proxy of distance and look-back time---based on imaging alone. \citet{newman15} summarize the case for a
%     significant spectroscopic campaign to calibrate and train LSST photometric redshifts in order to improve cosmological constraints.  They describe a redshift survey that,
%     if carried out with FOBOS, would increase LSST's Dark Energy figure-of-merit by 40\% at a cost of less than 5\% of
%     the LSST budget.  The urgent case for spectroscopic redshift training has been the subject of numerous publications
%     \citep[e.g.,][]{laureijs11, masters15, hemmati18}.

% Meanwhile, the astronomy community recognizes that the coming ``Big
% Data'' era, culminating in LSST, necessitates ``\textbf{harnessing the
% data revolution}.''  Widespread community interest in advanced
% data-science techniques continues to grow amidst calls for educational
% programs, conference series, and research funding to support the growth
% of a new field, ``Astroinformatics,'' which exploits the interface
% between astrophysics and statistics \citep{borne09}.  Astronomy's
% largest organizations, including the American Astronomical Society and
% the International Astronomical Union, have supported active working
% groups on astroinformatics and astrostatistics since 2015.  LSST itself
% has supported the Informatics and Statistics Science Collaboration and
% partnered with NSF on the Data Science Fellowship Program to train
% astronomy graduate students in data-science techniques.  Our proposal
% builds on and contributes to these ongoing efforts.
