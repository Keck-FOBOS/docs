\subsection{Globular cluster populations of galaxies}

Presently, it is very expensive to conduct systematic spectroscopic
studies of the various galaxy types in rich galaxy clusters, like
Coma, due to their angular spread on the sky. With FOBOS's flexible
fiber-positioning system and 17-arcminute FOV, it will be possible to
simultaneously (and efficiently) build up an unprecedented library of
spectroscopic redshifts and stellar-population parameters of galaxies
in clusters towards intermediate redshift. Follow-up FOBOS
observations using its deployable mini-IFUs will allow us to
simultaneously obtain resolved spectroscopy for 10s of these cluster
galaxies, enabling us to associate internal structures/properties of
the galaxies with their host cluster.

\subsection{The properties and coevolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters}

Similarly, probing the outskirts of nearby galaxies using globular
clusters (GCs) and/or planetary nebulae (PNe) is tedious and
inefficient with current facilities due to the sparse azimuthal
distribution of these chemodynamical tracers at large radii. FOBOS
will be a game changer in the study of the dynamical mass
distributions of nearby galaxies with $\mathcal{M_\ast/M_\odot}
\lesssim 10^{11}$, which typically host $\lesssim1500$ GCs
\citep{2013ApJ...772...82H}. This is because FOBOS makes it possible
to acquire spectra for nearly all GCs located to $\sim$50 kpc from
their host galaxy in a single night. These data will allow us to map
the chemodynamics of massive galaxy halos and infer orbital families
as a function of stellar-population properties. Additionally, we can
more quickly build statistically relevant models for GC formation in
the context of the larger galaxy population.

\subsection{Toward SDSS-like statistics at $z$$\sim$2}
\label{sec:galaxies}



Understand the $z \sim 2$ galaxy ``ecosystem,'' including not only
the galaxies themselves but their gas-filled environments. The goal
is to build a comprehensive picture of the physical processes that
fuel proto-galaxy growth, shape their internal structure, and
influence their environment.

\noindent\comment{Cooper?} Build SDSS-like statistics for galaxies at
this key cosmic epoch. Exploit short spectroscopic exposures in
combination with photometry to provide environmental diagnostics for
1M galaxies at $z$=1--2. Photometric redshifts, while acceptable in
large cosmological analyses, wash out information about the local
position of galaxies with respect to one another. To characterize a
galaxy's local environment and identify its neighbors requires
(observationally expensive) spectroscopic redshifts. However, with
improved photo-$z$s available from Challenge \ref{photozs} and strong
priors on spectral types (Challenge \ref{phot}), the challenge here
is to push machine-learning techniques to deliver
\emph{spectroscopic} redshifts (with 300 km s$^{-1}$ accuracy) at the
lowest signal-to-noise possible. Reductions by factors of 4--5 in
exposure time would enable FOBOS to complete a 1M galaxy environment
survey at $z=1$--$2$ in just 20-30 nights.

\comment{Hennawi, Schmidt}


% From George:
% - fill out case for probing both galaxies and their “gas-filled
%   environments”
%    - make it more explicit that getting large numbers of redshifts
%      would make it possible to trace out large-scale structure in
%      detail
%    - enables studies of galaxy properties as a function of environment
%
% - also mention targeting galaxies along QSO lines of sight
%    - much higher target density than with LRIS, DEIMOS over larger FOV.
%
% - Worth discussing Lyman-alpha or metal-line tomography?  
%
% - More quantitative comparisons with existing data sets?
%    - What key science questions can FOBOS address that many years of
%      LRIS and DEIMOS observations have not been able to?  Surely some
%      level of the spectral tagging and photo-z training can be done
%      (and surely is being done) with existing data.  Is FOBOS going to
%      be a huge leap, or will it mainly be cleaning up neglected corners
%      of parameter space?
%
% - More excited to hear about how the FOBOS spectra will be used for
%   science directly, instead of support for LSST
